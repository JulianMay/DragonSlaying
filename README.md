# Dragon Slaying 
This is stuff that proved useful when working with legacy code

the name is a reference to "Here be dragons" comments found in code the we don't understand or find hard to reason about when reading it.

- Maybe useful reference for you
- Maybe a note for myself about something that could be a workshop or presentation

_I think working with nasty legacy code is fun, in the same way hard nintendo-games are fun;_
_- once you get a grip on it, and find a way to make progress, it's like taking vengeance for all the frustration and comming out on top_
